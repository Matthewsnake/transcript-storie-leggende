00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.320
Welcome to "Atlas of Legends".

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:10.960
I'm Matteo, the voice that guides you through shadows, stories and of ancient

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:12.120
worlds.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:18.160
In this very first episode, I'll take you to a place where time seems to stand still.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.080
We’re in the Sibillini Mountains, where the wind carries a secret that has lived for ages.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.120
This is the legend of the Apennine Sibyl.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:37.080
Picture a summer night high in the Sibillini.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:44.280
The air is crisp, smelling of pine and earth, and above you stretches an endless sky, scattered

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.720
with stars.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:53.360
Around a crackling fire, the shepherds gather after a long day in the fields.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:01:02.560
It's time for the "Saltarello".

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:08.920
It's a wild joyful dance full of quick spins and clapping hands.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:16.640
Laughter fills the air and for a while the day's fatigue disappears.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:24.720
But on these nights of celebration, something extraordinary is said to happen.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:33.920
From the secret paths that twist through the mountains, they appear, the Sibyl’s fairies.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.880
Light as breath, bright as moonlight.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:44.320
They approach in silence, drawn by the music and the fire.

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:52.320
The young shepherds enchanted, hardly dare to move, afraid that a single gesture might break

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.320
the spell.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.800
Though breathtakingly beautiful, these are no ordinary girls.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:07.760
Their hair, like threads of silver, catches the firelight and in their eyes glows a deep

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.800
reflection as if ancient secrets lived within.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.480
But one detail reveals their true nature.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:23.320
Beneath their flowing garments, hidden from mortal sight are the hooves of a goat, a

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:29.480
mark of their bond with nature and the unknown.

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:36.040
Yet those hooves never slow them down, gracefully and sure-footed they climb the rocky slopes

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:49.960
with ease, fading back into the peaks as dawn approaches.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.960
Those fairies do more than dance the night away.

00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:01.440
It's said that, under the stars, they would "borrow" the farmer's horses to travel from one village

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.760
to another.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:11.560
By morning, the poor beasts were found exhausted.

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:21.160
Their mains braided into intricate patterns no human hand could ever weave.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:30.880
Those knots were the sign: the fairies had passed through the valley.

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.840
But who are these creatures, really?

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:42.760
To understand them, we have to go back to their origin, the Apennine Sibyl herself.

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:50.040
Legend says she lived in an underground palace, built of white marble and gleaming gold, surrounded

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.520
by her dancing maidens.

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:59.400
The only entrance to her realm is a hidden cave high on the mountain that bears her name.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:06.440
A cave that truly exists, and for centuries, it's drawn travelers from all across Europe.

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:12.160
The first to write about her was Andrea da Barberino in his tale "Guerrin Meschino"

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.440
around the year of 1410.

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:22.080
Guerrino is a wandering night, a man with no home searching for his origins.

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:27.240
His journey leads him to these very mountains where he meets the Sibyl.

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:34.120
She welcomes him gently, offering beauty, comfort and luxury beyond imagination.

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:39.880
But soon, Guerrino understands that this perfection is a prison.

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:45.880
And here comes the question. How hard is to walk away from something that seems perfect,

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.200
yet secretly keeps you trapped?

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:54.800
Then came Antoine de la Sal, a French nobleman fascinated by the stories that spread across

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.000
Europe.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:02.480
He decided to see it for himself, climbing to the summit of Mount Sibilla, he later described

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:09.600
what he found in his book, "Le Paradis de la Reine Sibylle" written around 1440.

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:15.880
He wrote of the entrance to the underground world, a dark mouth opening into the unknown,

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:20.840
a cold wind blew from within, like an ancient sigh.

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:27.080
And in that moment, he felt as though the line between reality and legend had vanished.

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:31.120
Because let's be honest, some places do that to you.

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:37.200
They shake something inside. You're no longer sure if you're inside a story... or if the

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.000
story is inside you.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:46.480
De la Sal returned home with answers, but with one conviction: there was something inside

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:50.440
that mountain... something not meant for human eyes.

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:56.760
But who is the Sibyl, really?

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:01.760
Oh, my friends, that's the question that has fascinated people for centuries.

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:09.280
For some, she's a wise woman, a seer who reads the stars and heals with forgotten herbs,

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:15.600
a prophetess, an oracle who speaks in riddles and reveals the paths of faith, but not everyone

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.840
sees her that way.

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:24.440
To others, she's a sorceress, a deceiver who lores travelers with promises of eternal pleasure,

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:27.440
only to imprison them forever.

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:33.400
Medieval Christian tales, shaped by the fate of the time, turned the Sibyl into an opposite

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:39.760
of the Virgin Mary, which stood for humility and purity while the Sibyl, with her prophetic

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:45.480
insight and desire for freedom, was seen as too powerful, too wise,

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:50.600
a woman who defied the boundaries set by heaven.

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:58.280
Her "fault" wasn't a sin of flesh, but of knowledge the audacity to know too much, to challenge

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:01.360
the limits given to humankind.

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:06.680
And so in some versions, she was condemned to live within the mountain, forever bound

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:09.640
by her own wisdom.

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:16.600
Yet not all stories agree. To many, the Sibyl remains a benevolent guide, a voice that offers

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:21.520
answers to those brave enough to face their destiny.

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:27.320
Over time, the legend absorbed echoes of older myths and literally figures.

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:35.080
In Ariosto "Orlando Furioso", the enchantresses, like Alcina, recalled the Sibyl herself, seductive

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:42.440
women, who lure heroes with promises and illusions, much like Circe in Homer’s Odyssey.

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:49.320
Likewise, the Sibyl fairies, who in some versions, are said to turn into snakes at night,

00:07:49.320 --> 00:08:01.560
resemble Melusine, the half-woman, half-serpent, creature of Medieval lore.

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:08.600
As the century is passed, the Sibyl was also linked to the Magna Mater, the ancient goddess

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:16.440
of fertility and to Cybele, symbol of wild nature and the creative power of the earth.

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:21.360
In this light, the Sibyl is more than a prophetess or a witch.

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:28.280
She becomes an ancient force tied to the cycle of life, to the raw and untamed energy of

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:29.280
nature itself.

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:40.680
This legend runs deep in the culture of the Sibillini mountains.

00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:46.080
To understand the role of dance and celebration, you have to picture the lives of farmers and

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:48.000
shepherds.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:54.840
The Saltarello was born from their traditions, from harvest festivals and the end of hard

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:55.360
labor.

00:08:55.360 --> 00:09:05.760
It was a moment of joy, when work gave way to music and laughter.

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:13.040
Its quick rhythm and lively steps often symbolize courtship, a playful dance between man and woman.

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:18.920
The name "Saltarello" first appeared in the 14th century in the London manuscript, now kept

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:21.120
at the British Museum.

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:26.880
Through the years, the dance evolved but it never lost its energy or charm.

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:33.600
By the mid 1800s, the small accordion, made especially in Castelfidardo in the Marche region,

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:39.440
replaced older instruments becoming the heart of this tradition.

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:46.400
To dance the Saltarello meant freedom, a chance to let go, to move with the pulse of the

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:55.000
earth and the seasons.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.440
But how did the Sibyl become tied to this dance?

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:03.120
After all, the ancient Sibyl's weren’t dancers.

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:07.960
They were seers who spoke the will of the gods.

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:15.040
Yet, over time, the Apennine Sibyl’s image blended with folk beliefs and local myths.

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:23.360
In the Middle Ages, tales of prophetesses fused with those of fairies and enchantresses.

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:29.680
The Sibyl became an ambiguous figure, one who could reveal destiny, yet was also drawn

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:32.720
to earthly delight.

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:40.200
Her maidens, the fairies, took center stage in the nightly dances, but they had one room,

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:47.560
they had to return to the cave before the rooster's crow.

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:53.400
Have you ever lost yourself in something so completely that time disappeared?

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:57.880
That’s what happened to one of the fairies.

00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:04.120
One night, she was so carried away by the rhythm, by the fire, by the laughter, that she forgot

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:08.720
everything else.

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:15.040
When dawn began to break and the first rooster sang through the valley.

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:22.160
The other fairies had already vanished in a shimmer of light. But she remained there,

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:30.400
eyes still fixed on the dance, as if the world itself had stopped.

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:37.560
They say that just before dissolving into a shower of silver sparks, she smiled, accepting

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:41.040
her fate with grace.

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:45.240
Today the cave of the Sibyl is no longer accessible.

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:52.560
In the early 1900s attempts to open it with explosives sealed its entrance forever.

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:57.960
But in the year 2000, radar scans revealed large underground chambers still hidden within

00:11:57.960 --> 00:11:58.960
the mountain.

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:06.200
It says if the Sibyl's realm still lies there, untouched beneath the rock.

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:12.880
At sunset, when the sun slips behind Mount Vettore and the shadows glide across the valleys,

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:16.200
some say they hear a faint melody carried by the wind.

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:22.280
A tune so soft and distant, it feels like a whisper from another word.

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:26.920
Maybe it's just imagination, or maybe it's the Sibyl herself,

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:32.240
telling her story to those whose hearts are still open enough to listen.

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:40.040
Because in the end legends speak about us, our desires, our fears, our temptations.

00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:46.400
They remind us that to dance is an act of freedom, but knowing when the dawn arrives, that

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:49.080
is an act of wisdom.

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:55.800
If you ever walk through those mountains, pause for a moment at sunset, listen to the wind,

00:12:55.800 --> 00:13:00.520
and who knows, you might just hear the echo of an ancient dance.

00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:10.480
