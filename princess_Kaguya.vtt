00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.320
Welcome to "Atlas of Legends".

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:15.840
Today, I'm taking you to Japan, into the heart of Heian period, a time of elegance, poetry

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.960
and extraordinary works of literature.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.160
Among these ancient tales, one stands out as one of the oldest and most captivating

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.440
stories in Japanese tradition, the tale of the bamboo cutter.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:34.000
Known in Japan as Taketori Monogatari.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.520
Written by Anonymous author around the 10th century, many see it as the father of

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:47.360
all Japanese fiction. It's not only the earliest known narrative written in classical Japanese.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:53.440
It's also one of the very first stories in the world to speak of beings who come... from

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.440
another place.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:02.760
So, let me guide you through the legend of "Princess Kaguya", a tale filled with beauty,

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.640
mystery and a quiet sadness, that lingers long after the story ends.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:14.280
Get comfortable and let the words take you with them.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:31.880
Our story begins with an old man, a bamboo cutter known as Taketori no Okina.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:39.960
Every day, he ventured into the forest to gather the finest bamboo and craft all kinds of objects.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:46.080
His life was simple and peaceful, shared with his beloved wife.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:53.080
But despite the love between them, the couple had no children and often looked to the sky

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.840
with a quiet longing in their hearts.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:04.560
Then one day, as sunlight filtered through the green leaves, something extraordinary happened.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:10.680
Among the bamboo swinging in the wind, one stalk glowed with a golden light.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.880
The old man stopped, stunned.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.640
With trembling hands, he cut the stalk open.

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:25.800
Inside, wrapped in a warm gentle radiance, was a tiny girl, no bigger than the palm of

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.800
his hand.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:34.520
Her eyes sparkled like stars and her skin was pale like the moon.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:41.200
The bamboo cutter lifted her carefully and believed she must be a gift from the heavens.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.920
How often do unexpected gifts change the course of our lives?

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:53.200
Sometimes, what arrives without warning brings both immense joy and challenges we could

00:02:53.200 --> 00:03:00.120
never foresee.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:06.380
When he returned home, he showed a tiny girl to his wife, who welcomed her with love and

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.600
astonishment.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.840
From that moment on, their lives changed forever.

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:19.920
Each time the old man cut another bamboo stalk, he found small piles of shining gold inside.

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:25.640
Before long, the couple became wealthy and respected, but their new found fortune never made them

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.000
proud or arrogant.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:38.720
Their real joy was the miraculous daughter they had been given.

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:46.400
The little girl grew quickly, as if time itself moved differently for her.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:52.760
In just a few months, she became a young woman of extraordinary beauty.

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:59.720
Three months after finding her, the couple called an astrologer to give her a name.

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:10.480
And she was called Nayotake no Kaguya-hime, "the shining princess of the slender bamboo".

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:16.200
Despite the couple's attempts to keep their lives quiet, news of Kaguya's beauty spread

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.680
quickly.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:26.280
Men of every rank, from merchants and samurai to powerful nobles, gathered around the bamboo

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:32.280
cutter's home, hoping to catch even a glimpse of her.

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:40.120
The house became surrounded by suitors, hiding behind hedges, waiting for the chance to draw

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.320
her attention.

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:47.960
But Kaguya stayed distant, refusing every proposal with a gentle, almost melancholic

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.960
grace.

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:56.840
Over time, most of those men gave up and returned to their lives.

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:03.400
Only five nobles remained, circling the house day after day, hoping she might change

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.400
her mind.

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:12.880
The bamboo cutter, now old and worried about his daughter's future, urged her to choose

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:19.320
a husband, someone who could care for her after he was gone.

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:28.080
Kaguya agreed reluctantly, but decided she would test the sincerity of the five men.

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:34.240
Trials often reveal a person's true nature, don't they?

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:42.840
Sometimes I wonder if a man's worth lies not in the goals he chases, but in what is willing

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:54.680
to face with humility.

00:05:54.680 --> 00:06:01.400
The first suitor, Prince Ishizukuri, was tasked with finding the Buddha's stone beggin

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:02.400
bowl.

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:08.760
A sacred relic said to be kept in distant temples in India.

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:14.560
But knowing he could never make such a journey, he found a simple black bowl in a monastery

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:20.080
in Yamato province, and tried to fool Kaguya with it.

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:26.080
She examined it closely and immediately saw through the lie. The bowl didn't shine with

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:30.080
the divine glow he was supposed to have.

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:36.560
Exposed and ashamed, Ishizukuri withdrew, humiliated by his failure.

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:42.440
The second suitor, Isonokami no Marotari, was told to obtain a shell that appeared

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:47.360
only at the moment a Swallow gave birth.

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:52.640
After repeated failures, he met an old man who advised him to wait on the roof near

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:56.640
the nest at just the right moment.

00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:04.560
But while waiting, Isonokami lost his balance and fell, injuring himself badly.

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:13.680
Humiliated and mocked for his misfortune, he fell into a deep depression, and let himself die.

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:20.360
The third suitor, Prince Kuramochi, was asked to bring back a branch from the legendary tree

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:22.800
on the island of Horai.

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:28.520
A tree of silver roots, a golden trunk, and jeweled branches.

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:34.840
He set off boasting loudly about his quest, but in secret, he ordered the finest craftsman

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:37.760
to create an exquisite fake.

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:44.040
Kaguya was amazed at first and listened carefully to his tale of heroic deeds.

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:51.120
Resigned to keeping her promise, she began preparing to marry him, until suddenly, the craftsmen

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:56.920
appeared in the courtyard demanding their payment, exposing the deception.

00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:02.640
Kuramochi, humiliated, had no choice but to leave.

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:09.580
The fourth suitor, Abe no Mimuraji, was tasked with finding a robe made from the skin of the

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:10.580
fire rat.

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:15.760
A garment said to be completely fireproof.

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:22.200
He entrusted the search to a friend in China, but after a long effort, the only robe he

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:25.880
received turned out to be a fake.

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:33.360
To prove its authenticity, Abe placed it over a flame, and it burned to ashes.

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:39.560
Defeated, he wrote Kaguya a letter, confessing his failure.

00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:46.920
The fifth suitor, Otomo no Miyuki, was asked to retrieve a multicolored jewel from the neck

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:49.120
of a sea dragon.

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:55.800
Otomo wasn't known for his bravery, so he sent his soldiers and servants first, hoping they

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:59.120
managed the impossible task for him.

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:02.960
Meanwhile, he was already celebrating in his mind.

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:10.520
He even had a magnificent palace built, convinced that victory and Kaguya, were already his.

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:13.600
A year passed, no one returned.

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:17.280
So Otomo finally set out himself.

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:25.000
He ordered the boat to be prepared, gathered a new group of soldiers, all clearly terrified,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:32.320
and declared himself the bravest among them, insisting they should be just as fearless.

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:40.640
But once they reached the open sea, after a few calm days, a violent storm suddenly struck.

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:47.160
Otomo, trembling with fear, crawled to the bottom of the boat and started whimpering like a

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:48.160
child.

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:53.520
His crew disappointed and disgusted by such cowardice, mocked him.

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:59.240
They told him the storm must be the dragon's doing, and that it would only calm down

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:01.880
if they abandoned the quest.

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:05.000
Otomo agreed immediately.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:12.160
Once back on land, his war of ships forever, and lived out his days in solitude on that

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:22.400
remote island.

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:29.040
After the failure of all five suitors, Kaguya faced a new challenge.

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:33.360
The interest of the Emperor himself.

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:39.640
Having heard of her legendary beauty, he was determined to meet her.

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:46.880
But Kaguya had no intention of yielding, not even to an imperial request.

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:49.560
People were shocked.

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:53.640
How could any young woman refuse the Emperor?

00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:58.320
However, he wasn't willing to accept defeat.

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:04.880
With the bamboo cutter's reluctant help, he planned a visit during a hunting trip and arrived

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:09.840
at the house, intending to take Kaguya away.

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:15.600
She fought back with all the strength she had, and just as the guards were about to lift

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:21.440
her onto the imperial carriage, she vanished, right in front of their eyes.

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:27.240
In that moment, the Emperor understood: she didn't belong to this world.

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:33.880
Heartbroken, he returned to his palace, filled with sorrow and confusion.

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:40.400
Some time later, Kaguya told her adoptive father that the moment had come.

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:46.440
She had fulfilled her time on Earth, she said, and soon they would come to take her

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:49.480
back to where she belongs.

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:57.240
The old man was devastated, overwhelmed by grief, he went to the Emperor for help.

00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:03.080
The Emperor responded by sending 2,000 soldiers to surround the house, determined to stop

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:15.240
anyone, or anything, from taking her away.

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:20.800
But one night, the sky above the house exploded with light.

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:28.280
A group of celestial beings descend from the heavens, wrapped in a brilliant glow, riding

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:31.560
upon a floating cloud.

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:38.480
The imperial soldiers, powerless before such a vision, stood frozen where they were, and

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:44.360
the bamboo cutter and his wife, thrown to the ground by their own sorrow, could do nothing

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:47.080
but cry in despair.

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:54.200
Kaguya, her heart heavy with sadness, said goodbye to the man who had raised her.

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:59.360
She didn't want to leave earth, but she had no choice.

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:04.480
Before following the celestial beings, she wrote a gentle letter for the old man and another

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:11.840
for the Emperor, along with a small vail containing the elixir of immortality.

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:32.200
Then, without hesitation, she rose into the sky and returned to her true home: the moon.

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:38.880
The commander of the imperial guard brought the letters and the elixir back to the capital.

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:44.200
When the Emperor read Kaguya's words, he fell into a deep sorrow.

00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:51.640
He stopped eating, cancelled all court celebrations, and withdrew into himself.

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:56.480
One day, overwhelmed by grief, he made a decision.

00:13:56.480 --> 00:14:02.040
He ordered a messenger to climb the tallest mountain in the kingdom and burned the vail

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:07.320
along with a poem he had written by his own hand.

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:14.000
A poem in which he declared that immortality meant nothing if he couldn't share life with

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.760
Kaguya.

00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:23.800
The messenger, escorted by a group of soldiers, climbed to the peak and carried out the order.

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:31.600
As the flames rose, the vail and the letter disappeared, like a final farewell carried into

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:34.040
the sky.

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:37.920
Maybe true love doesn't seek immortality.

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:43.640
Maybe it prefers to live in memory where it remains eternal without needing to possess

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:47.440
anything.

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:54.920
From that day on, that mountain was named Fuji, meaning "immortal", in memory of a love

00:14:54.920 --> 00:15:08.400
that could never be, and of the eternal longing that forever linked earth and the moon.

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:12.400
